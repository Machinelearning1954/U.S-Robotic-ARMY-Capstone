Leveraging both the Indian Vehicle Dataset (50,000+ civilian vehicles) and Military Assets Dataset (26,315 military objects) will enable superior discrimination between military and civilian assets, a critical capability for tactical AI systems.

**Innovation 4: Explainable AI Integration**  
Implementing explainability features will provide transparency and trust in automated decisions, addressing a key gap in current military AI systems.

**Innovation 5: Optimized Edge Deployment**  
Advanced optimization techniques will enable deployment on edge devices with minimal performance degradation, supporting autonomous operations in contested environments.
